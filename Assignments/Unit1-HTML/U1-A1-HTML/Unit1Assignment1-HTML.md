# Unit 1 - HTML
## Assignment 1 - Create your first HTML Document!

**Description**: 

Welcome to the Front End developer class! This assignment
is both an assignment that you would normally see for this

well as many items that you should also complete to get

This week, please complete `Repository Setup` and `About you` below. Then
follow the instructions to hand in your work.

## Repository Setup

see your progress and review your work as you go.
  
## About You

of text about you.
