# Unit 2 - JavaScript
## Assignment 1 - Build a static/dynamic web page!!

**Description**: 

In this assignment you will create your first HTML page that displays
content dynamically.  Normally this content would come from a back end service,
but for this assignment, you will simply use a blob of JSON and JavaScript. You
can complete this assignment using the existing page that you already built
in Assignment 2, or you can start a new page, it's up to you!
  
## Dynamic page

Create a script block on your HTML page that will:

1. Wait for the page to load, before executing code (wait for the DOM event that indicates that the page has loaded.).
1. Add a JSON blob and set it to a variable 
1. Create HTML elements that can be found using JavaScript.
  - Create at least one that has an ID
  - Create at least one that is found as a child of the one with an ID
  - Create at least two that is found based on a class.
1. Now add JavaScript that will find the HTML elements above, and update their content on the page using data from the JSON variable that you created in the step above.
1. Ensure that the updated elements still have the original styles on it.


**Bonus**: 
- Randomly update the color of the background of the page.
- Change the title of the page.
