1. Create a personal portfolio website that includes the following elements:
   - Link to your GitHub account
   - Information about you! (an about you section)
   - Link to your other websites as you feel like you would
   want to share.  LinkedIn is a great choice.
   - Information about what you know, this section will grow over time.
2. Place your portfolio page up for the world to see using GitHub as a hosting platform.
